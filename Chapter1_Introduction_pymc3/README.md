Chapter 1: Introduction to Bayesian Methods
===========

This is a variant of Chapter 1 with code written in [PyMC3](https://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc3/getting_started/) with [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) optimizations. 
Environment is set up using [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), it can be created using `conda create --name env --file req.txt`, more about getting started with Anaconda can be found [here](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/intro.htmlhttp://conda.pydata.org/docs/intro.html).

In case PyMC3 installation errors out at environment creation, try: `pip install --process-dependency-links git+https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3`.
