    "The previous two chapters hid the inner-mechanics of PyMC3, and more generally Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), from the reader. The reason for including this chapter is three-fold. The first is that any book on Bayesian inference must discuss MCMC. I cannot fight this. Blame the statisticians. Secondly, knowing the process of MCMC gives you insight into whether your algorithm has converged. (Converged to what? We will get to that) Thirdly, we'll understand *why* we are returned thousands of samples from the posterior as a solution, which at first thought can be odd. "

    "### The Bayesian landscape\n",
    "\n",
    "When we setup a Bayesian inference problem with $N$ unknowns, we are implicitly creating an $N$ dimensional space for the prior distributions to exist in. Associated with the space is an additional dimension, which we can describe as the *surface*, or *curve*, that sits on top of the space, that reflects the *prior probability* of a particular point. The surface on the space is defined by our prior distributions. For example, if we have two unknowns $p_1$ and $p_2$, and priors for both are $\\text{Uniform}(0,5)$, the space created is a square of length 5 and the surface is a flat plane that sits on top of the square (representing that every point is equally likely).

    "If these surfaces describe our *prior distributions* on the unknowns, what happens to our space after we incorporate our observed data $X$? The data $X$ does not change the space, but it changes the surface of the space by *pulling and stretching the fabric of the prior surface* to reflect where the true parameters likely live. More data means more pulling and stretching, and our original shape becomes mangled or insignificant compared to the newly formed shape. Less data, and our original shape is more present.  Regardless, the resulting surface describes the *posterior distribution*. \n",

For two dimensions, the data essentially *pushes up* the original surface to make *tall mountains*. The tendency of the observed data to *push up* the posterior probability in certain areas is checked by the prior probability distribution, so that less prior probability means more resistance. Thus in the double-exponential prior case above, a mountain (or multiple mountains) that might erupt near the (0,0) corner would be much higher than mountains that erupt closer to (5,5), since there is more resistance (low prior probability) near (5,5). The peak reflects the posterior probability of where the true parameters are likely to be found. Importantly, if the prior has assigned a probability of 0, then no posterior probability will be assigned there. \n",

Notice the exponential-prior landscape, bottom right figure, puts very little *posterior* weight on values in the upper right corner of the figure: this is because *the prior does not put much weight there*.

    "### Exploring the landscape using the MCMC\n",
    "\n",
    "We should explore the deformed posterior space generated by our prior surface and observed data to find the posterior mountain. However, we cannot naively search the space: any computer scientist will tell you that traversing $N$-dimensional space is exponentially difficult in $N$: the size of the space quickly blows-up as we increase $N$ (see [the curse of dimensionality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality)). What hope do we have to find these hidden mountains? The idea behind MCMC is to perform an intelligent search of the space. To say \"search\" implies we are looking for a particular point, which is perhaps not an accurate as we are really looking for a broad mountain. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that MCMC returns *samples* from the posterior distribution, not the distribution itself. Stretching our mountainous analogy to its limit, MCMC performs a task similar to repeatedly asking  \"How likely is this pebble I found to be from the mountain I am searching for?\", and completes its task by returning thousands of accepted pebbles in hopes of reconstructing the original mountain. In MCMC and PyMC3 lingo, the returned sequence of \"pebbles\" are the samples,  cumulatively called the *traces*. \n",
    "\n",
    "When I say MCMC intelligently searches, I really am saying MCMC will *hopefully* converge towards the areas of high posterior probability. MCMC does this by exploring nearby positions and moving into areas with higher probability. Again, perhaps \"converge\" is not an accurate term to describe MCMC's progression. Converging usually implies moving towards a point in space, but MCMC moves towards a *broader area* in the space and randomly walks in that area, picking up samples from that area.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Thousands of Samples?\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, returning thousands of samples to the user might sound like being an inefficient way to describe the posterior distributions. I would argue that this is extremely efficient. Consider the alternative possibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Returning a mathematical formula for the \"mountain ranges\" would involve describing a N-dimensional surface with arbitrary peaks and valleys.\n",
    "2. Returning the \"peak\" of the landscape, while mathematically possible and a sensible thing to do as the highest point corresponds to most probable estimate of the unknowns, ignores the shape of the landscape, which we have previously argued is very important in determining posterior confidence in unknowns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides computational reasons, likely the strongest reason for returning samples is that we can easily use *The Law of Large Numbers* to solve otherwise intractable problems. I postpone this discussion for the next chapter. With the thousands of samples, we can reconstruct the posterior surface by organizing them in a histogram. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithms to perform MCMC\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a large family of algorithms that perform MCMC. Most of these algorithms can be expressed at a high level as follows: (Mathematical details can be found in the appendix.)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start at current position.\n",
    "2. Propose moving to a new position (investigate a pebble near you).\n",
    "3. Accept/Reject the new position based on the position's adherence to the data and prior distributions (ask if the pebble likely came from the mountain).\n",
    "4.  1.  If you accept: Move to the new position. Return to Step 1.\n",
    "    2. Else: Do not move to new position. Return to Step 1. \n",
    "5. After a large number of iterations, return all accepted positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way we move in the general direction towards the regions where the posterior distributions exist, and collect samples sparingly on the journey. Once we reach the posterior distribution, we can easily collect samples as they likely all belong to the posterior distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the current position of the MCMC algorithm is in an area of extremely low probability, which is often the case when the algorithm begins (typically at a random location in the space), the algorithm will move in positions *that are likely not from the posterior* but better than everything else nearby. Thus the first moves of the algorithm are not reflective of the posterior.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above algorithm's pseudocode, notice that only the current position matters (new positions are investigated only near the current position). We can describe this property as *memorylessness*, i.e. the algorithm does not care *how* it arrived at its current position, only that it is there. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Other approximation solutions to the posterior\n",
    "Besides MCMC, there are other procedures available for determining the posterior distributions. A Laplace approximation is an approximation of the posterior using simple functions. A more advanced method is [Variational Bayes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_Bayesian_methods). All three methods, Laplace Approximations, Variational Bayes, and classical MCMC have their pros and cons. We will only focus on MCMC in this book. That being said, my friend Imri Sofar likes to classify MCMC algorithms as either \"they suck\", or \"they really suck\". He classifies the particular flavour of MCMC used by PyMC3 as just *sucks* ;)"

This would still satisfy the evidence, albeit less so than our original inference. Alternatively, it would be incredibly unlikely for *both* distributions to have a small standard deviation, as the data does not support this hypothesis at all. Thus the two standard deviations are *dependent* on each other: if one is small, the other must be large. In fact, *all* the unknowns are related in a similar manner. For example, if a standard deviation is large, the mean has a wider possible space of realizations. Conversely, a small standard deviation restricts the mean to a small area. \n",

In fact, this is what it means to say the MCMC converged (in practice though we can never achieve total convergence). Hence if we observe different posterior analysis, it is likely because our MCMC has not fully converged yet, and we should not use samples from it yet (we should use a larger burn-in period ).\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, poor starting values can prevent any convergence, or significantly slow it down. Ideally, we would like to have the chain start at the *peak* of our landscape, as this is exactly where the posterior distributions exist. Hence, if we started at the \"peak\", we could avoid a lengthy burn-in period and incorrect inference. Generally, we call this \"peak\" the *maximum a posterior* or, more simply, the *MAP*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, we do not know where the MAP is. PyMC3 provides a function that will approximate, if not find, the MAP location. In the PyMC3 main namespace is the `find_MAP` function. If you call this function within the context of `Model()`, it will calculate the MAP which you can then pass to `pm.sample()` as a `start` parameter.\n",

The default optimization algorithm in function call is the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno ([BFGS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno_algorithm)) algorithm to find the maximum of the log-posterior. As an alternative, you can use other optimization algorithms from the `scipy.optimize` module. For example, you can use Powell's Method, a favourite of PyMC blogger [Abraham Flaxman](http://healthyalgorithms.com/) [1], by calling `find_MAP(fmin=scipy.optimize.fmin_powell)`. The default works well enough, but if convergence is slow or not guaranteed, feel free to experiment with Powell's method or the other algorithms available. \n",

We can no longer automatically discard sample with a `burn` parameter in the `sample()` function as we could in PyMC2, but it is easy enough to simply discard the beginning section of the trace just through array slicing. As one does not know when the chain has fully converged, a good rule of thumb is to discard the first *half* of your samples, sometimes up to 90% of the samples for longer runs.

We won't get into the latter, but the former can be interpreted as \"there is a 95% chance the parameter of interest lies in this interval\". When communicating your results to others, it is incredibly important to state this interval. One of our purposes for studying Bayesian methods is to have a clear understanding of our uncertainty in unknowns.

    "\n",
    "Bayesian inference would be the *de facto* method if it weren't for MCMC's computational difficulties. In fact, MCMC is what turns most users off practical Bayesian inference. Below I present some good heuristics to help convergence and speed up the MCMC engine:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intelligent starting values\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be great to start the MCMC algorithm off near the posterior distribution, so that it will take little time to start sampling correctly. We can aid the algorithm by telling where we *think* the posterior distribution will be by specifying the `testval` parameter in the `Stochastic` variable creation. In many cases we can produce a reasonable guess for the parameter. For example, if we have data from a Normal distribution, and we wish to estimate the $\\mu$ parameter, then a good starting value would be the *mean* of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "     mu = pm.Uniform( \"mu\", 0, 100, testval = data.mean() )\n",
    "\n",
    "For most parameters in models, there is a frequentist estimate of it. These estimates are a good starting value for our MCMC algorithms. Of course, this is not always possible for some variables, but including as many appropriate initial values is always a good idea. Even if your guesses are wrong, the MCMC will still converge to the proper distribution, so there is little to lose.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what using `MAP` tries to do, by giving good initial values to the MCMC. So why bother specifying user-defined values? Well, even giving `MAP` good values will help it find the maximum a-posterior. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also important, *bad initial values* are a source of major bugs in PyMC3 and can hurt convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Priors\n",
    "\n",
    "If the priors are poorly chosen, the MCMC algorithm may not converge, or atleast have difficulty converging. Consider what may happen if the prior chosen does not even contain the true parameter: the prior assigns 0 probability to the unknown, hence the posterior will assign 0 probability as well. This can cause pathological results.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, it is best to carefully choose the priors. Often, lack of covergence or evidence of samples crowding to boundaries implies something is wrong with the chosen priors (see *Folk Theorem of Statistical Computing* below). \n",
